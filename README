CNC Plotter code
All drawing functions are also able to be run via turtle, so this can be tested on any machine

Draw.py is main module.  It must be run with Driver.py, EdgeTracer.py, Crosshatcher.py, and 
  image file to be drawn in same directory (technically Driver.py can be left out, as long as
  you are only ever using turtle to output drawing.)  
To run with turtle, set outputMode = 0 (in Draw.py)
Set imageString = filename of image to be drawn.  Compatible extensions are JPG, PNG, BMP (I'm
  actually not sure what else, so far I haven't run into compatibility issues)
Set computeMode = 0 for Crosshatching or = 1 for Edgetracing

Module dependencies:
  Python libraries:
    turtle
    math
    collections
    time

  Go get these yourself:
    PIL
    numpy
    matplotlib (only if drawing with CNC)
